**Learning is a journey that never ends, but it’s also never easy.** 

Luckily, platforms like YouTube offer countless educational videos to learn new concepts from different perspectives. However, watching videos to study for an upcoming test is extremely time consuming and this time adds up quickly. In today’s world, there simply isn’t a way to watch educational videos “faster” without compromising on understanding. 

That’s where Summer comes in. Simply paste the link to the video you would like to learn, and you will be presented a concise summary of the video with all of its main points, along with a quiz to solidify your understanding. Behind the scenes, Summer will use AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse the transcript of the video and consolidate the main points, while also intelligently generating a quiz based on the transcript’s content.

## MVP
-   Fetch videos from inputted URLs

-   Summarize the transcript into an easy-to-read document

-   Generate an interactive quiz based on the content of the transcript

-   Allow users to store their “Summer”-ized videos in a library


## Stretch Goals
-   Automate the whole study process - Once you generate a quiz, you can generate things like flashcards, mini-games, etc.

-   Modify the algorithm so that it will not only summarize text, but also take the key scenes from the video to compose a completely summarized video

-   Allow the summarized transcript to be interactive, so that when the user clicks a portion of the text, it redirects them to that part of the video
